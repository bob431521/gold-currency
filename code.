function fetchGoldPrice() {
    return fetch('https://www.goldprice.org/api/gold')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => data.price);
}


This function uses the fetch API to make a GET request to the specified URL and returns a promise that resolves to the current gold price in US dollars. The .json() method is used to parse the response as a JSON object, and the data.price property is used to access the current gold price.

You can use the function like this:


fetchGoldPrice().then(price => console.log(price));
